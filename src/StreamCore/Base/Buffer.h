//!
//! \brief Abstarct Base class for all Backend specific Buffers.
//! Provides very low level functionalities required for Buffer creation 
//! and data transfer.
//! 
//! Construction - The object is created based on lazy evaluation.
//! Buffer is created during StreamRead and kernel invocation (only for output) .
//! 
//! Destruction - BufferMgr contains the cache of Buffers and associate a flag 
//! to each buffer mentioning whether it is in use or not. 
//! Unused buffers are deleted if application need a different sized buffer
//! and buffer allocation fails. All the buffers are deleted when application exits.
//!
//! Error conditions - It can generate errors during creation and data transfer.
//! Its BufferMgr's responsibility to handle these error conditions.
