IL Preprocessor
================================================================================
The Shader Analyzer & Kernel Analyzer provided by AMD have an option to generate 
IL Assembly header files for IL developer. The header files generated by those 
tools contain a C string declaration of the IL source code. The developer can 
use that string directly in their code. 

However, the C string generated by those tools is without return line indicator,
which make them fail to compile in CAL. I hate adding '\n's to those string 
every time I regenerate my code in SA and KA. So I wrote this tool...
