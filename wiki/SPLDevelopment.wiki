#summary How to contribute to AMD-SPL

= Introduction =

If you are interested in contributing ideas or modifications to the project, then this document is for you. 

Currently, to develop the AMD-SPL, developers need to use the AMD CAL(compute abstraction layer) to do GPGPU. In our SPL, we have a [SPLRuntime runtime] that encapsulate the CAL function calls that needed to do AMD-SPL development. 

The runtime we developed try to make CAL development easier. However, there is no obligation for a SPL developer to always use the SPL runtime, a developer can also uses pure CAL functions when SPL runtime cannot satisfy her/his need. 

== Discussing AMD-SPL ==
As always, discuss AMD-SPL in the official [http://groups.google.com/group/amd-spl AMD-SPL discussion group]. You don't have to actually submit code in order to sign up. Your participation itself is a valuable contribution.

== contribute to the runtime ==
Currently, the runtime is still not stable. we don't allow developers to do modification to the runtime. However, developers can still check out the runtime and read the code. If you have some ideas to improve the runtime, feel free to raise an issue in the issues tag. We would like discuss it.
