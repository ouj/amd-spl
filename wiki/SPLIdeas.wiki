1, Dynamic Data Transfer:
There are 3 ways to transfer data from main memory to GPU local memory
  * 1, Alloc Remote Buffer using CAL API, copying user data to remote buffer, then DMA to GPU local memory
  * 2, Alloc Pinned Buffer using CAL API extension, put data to an aligned user memory chunk, then DMA to GPU local memory
  * 3, Mapping GPU local memory to a main memory address, then put user data using this address pointer.


2, bind resource improvement
When we create a res, just get its memory handle immediately, which may cause some latency at runtime. When binding the res to a program, what we only need to do is set this memory handle to a memory name which is using in the IL program. the later operation is always fast at runtime.
