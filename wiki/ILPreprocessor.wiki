= Introduction =

IL Preprocessor is a development tool used to generate a C++ string of IL source code and work around a bug in AMD’s Stream KernelAnalyzer. In SKA, there is an object code format option named IL assembly .h file, which will generate a C++ string of IL. However, currently there is a bug in SKA. The C++ string generated by SKA is without newline character after every line of code, which will cause it failed to be compiled. This IL Preprocessor tool can be used to generate corrected C++ string from IL source file.

= HOW TO USE =

== SAVE THE IL SOURCE FILE ==
After finishing coding in SKA, click Save Source of Save Source As… to save the IL source into a plain text file.

== LOCATE THE SOURCE FILE IN IL PREPROCESSOR TOOL ==
Launch the IL Preprocessor tool, and Browse the IL source file that saved in last step. The IL Preprocessor will generate the C++ string definition of the source code in the display panel below immediately.

== COPY THE C++ STRING ==
User can copy the entire C++ string definition by click the Copy to Clipboard button, or just copy a part of the C++ string by selecting them in the display panel and press the keyboard shortcut Ctrl + C.

== RELOAD THE IL SOURCE ==
If any changes are made in SKA, the C++ string needs to be regenerated. To do this, the user need to save the IL source again in SKA by clicking Save Source or pressing Ctrl + S, and press the Reload button in IL Preprocessor, the C++ string in display panel will be refreshed to the latest version.

= NOTICE =
The major function of this tool is to work around a bug in SKA. This bug will definitely be fixed in future release. At that time, developer can drop this tool and enjoy seamless C++ string generation in SKA.
