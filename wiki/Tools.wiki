#summary development tools of amd-spl project

= Introduction =
This page is about the development tool of amd-spl project. Some of them are also useful for CAL and IL development


= Details =
==IL Preprocessor==
The Shader Analyzer & Kernel Analyzer provided by AMD have an option to generate IL Assembly header files for IL developer. The header files generated by those tools contain a C string declaration of the IL source code. The developer can use that string directly in their code. 

However, the C string generated by those tools is without return line indicator, which make them fail to compile in CAL. Developer have to add '\n's to those string every time IL code is regenerated. This tool can be a work around before the new version of Shader Analyzer or Kernel Analyzer fix this problem.

==Digi Translator==
In IL, literal values are declared in hex representation. The Shader Analyzer & Kernel Analyzer will translate those hex representation into decimal float point value. When the developer wants a hex representation of a number, this tool can translate a float, int and unsigned int value into hex representation.
