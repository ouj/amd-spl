== Introduction ==

AMD SPL is a programming library based on AMD's stream computing technology. This library will provide common general purpose computing function such as sorting and prefix sum. This project aims to provide some common functions for GPGPU and makes AMD's GPGPU programming easier.

== Language Binding == 

This library itself is implemented in standard C++ and AMD IL. 

  * OpenCL
    [http://www.khronos.org/opencl/ OpenCL] is a new industry standard for parallel computing. OpenCL binding will be ready after any implementation is released.

  * C/C++
    Any C/C++ code can link to it freely.
