== Introduction ==

AMD SPL is a programming library based on AMD's stream computing technology. This library will provide common general purpose computing function such as sorting and prefix sum. This project aims to provide some common functions for GPGPU and makes AMD's GPGPU programming easier.

== Run Time ==
Although the amd-spl runtime is not a part of user interface, it is the core of the library. It communicates with the hardwares using CAL & IL, and provides GPGPU service to other modules of the library. Other modules will use the classes and functions provided by the core runtime to implement their algorithms.

The performance of the runtime will greatly affect the performance of the library. Currently, we use a modified runtime of Brook+. However, it is not satisfactory. We are developing our own [SPLRuntime Runtime]. 

== Language Binding == 

This library itself is implemented in standard C++ and AMD IL. 

  * [http://www.khronos.org/opencl/ OpenCL]: OpenCL is a new industry standard for parallel computing. AMD OpenCL implementation will be released in 2009. OpenCL binding will be ready after that.

  * C/C++: Any C/C++ code can link to it freely. 
  
  * C#: Planned.

  * Java: Planned.
